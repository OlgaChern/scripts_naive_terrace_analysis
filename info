Here are the necessary settings:

1. script-run-cov-to-TSC-for-taxa.sh
	- specify: f_path

2. script-split-space-into-terraces.sh 
	- instal iqtree_terrace and add a binary with a path
	- add a binary with a path for iqtree itself
	- here you could change the trees to be used:
		trees=$f_input/trees/all_trees_${taxa}
